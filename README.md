# Spark - AI-Powered E-commerce Search

A proof-of-concept demonstrating **AI semantic search as a service** for e-commerce platforms.

**🔗 Live Demo:** https://spark-fashion-search.vercel.app/store

## What is this?

Spark shows how merchants can embed an AI-powered search widget that understands natural language queries like *"blue dress for beach wedding"* instead of just keyword matching. It also supports merchandising rules (boost, bury, filter, banners) to give merchants control over search results.

> ⚠️ This is a POC/demo build, not production-ready code.
